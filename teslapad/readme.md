## teslapad

This is my experimental split virtual-keyboard which is customised
to my own requirements and runs on a 8-inch tablet.

You can dictate words and sentences and it will type them out for you.

Feel free to fork and hack as required!

## to run

From your rkeys-apps directory:

    $ rkeys teslapad

then point your tablet browser to one of the following:

left hand: TODO

right hand: `http://your-rkeys-server-name-or-ip:7000/r`
