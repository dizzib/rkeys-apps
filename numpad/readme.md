## numpad

A quick example demonstrating a simple layout.

This app pulls in and restyles the [numpad mixin](../mixin/numpad.jade) which is
also used and restyled by [teslapad](../teslapad).

Notice how it makes heavy use of the core
[keys mixin](https://github.com/dizzib/rkeys/tree/master/site/ui/mixin).

## to run

From your rkeys-apps directory:

    $ rkeys numpad

then point your tablet browser to `http://your-rkeys-server-name-or-ip:7000/numpad`
