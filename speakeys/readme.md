## speakeys

I use this to transmit dictated speech from my tablet
directly to my Linux desktop as if I were typing it in myself.

Currently [Google Chrome][chrome] is the only browser to support
speech recognition.

## to run

From your rkeys-apps directory:

    $ rkeys speakeys

then point your tablet's [Chrome browser][chrome] to
`http://your-rkeys-server-name-or-ip:7000/speakeys`


[chrome]: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/mobile/index.html
[rkeys]: https://github.com/dizzib/rkeys
